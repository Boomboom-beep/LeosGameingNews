    <h2>Gboard's Unusual Shape Keyboard</h2>
    <p>The new Gboard keyboard has sparked discussions due to its unconventional shape, which some players find quite bizarre. Developed by their Japanese department, the keyboard's design seems to have a playful tone. In the trailer, the creators humorously express their dislike for using keyboards upside down, making it feel like a lighthearted joke. While it's not set to go into production, a 3D model has been released on GitHub for those who want to try it out.</p>
    <p>A video showcasing the keyboard can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHqPrHTN1dU">here</a>.</p>
