    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>The new Gboard keyboard, developed by their Japanese department, features an unconventional shape that many people find quite weird. The trailer humorously suggests they "hate when they use their keyboard upside down," leading some to wonder if this design is a joke. While this unique keyboard is not currently being produced, a 3D model has been released on GitHub for enthusiasts to explore. Although it aims to enhance ergonomics and provide a unique typing experience, its practicality and effectiveness in everyday use are still in question.</p>
